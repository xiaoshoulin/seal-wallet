--- | Tries to check the existence of the DB at 'FilePath'. It first tries to

-- for absolute path.
-- This is sometimes necessary if the DB path is given with paths like
-- '../wallet-db'. Apparently `doesDirectoryExist` for such a relative path
-- was returning 'False', after making the path absolute.

-- | Migrates all wallets present in the Keystore by restoring each wallet from
-- its encrypted secret key. Since the spending password is not available, we
-- cannot create a default address for new wallets. This has the effect that
-- the user won't be able to rely on transacting with a default address
-- while restoration is in progress.
--
-- When @forced@ is False we are lenient in logging any error and continuing
-- rather than crashing the node. The rationale is that if
-- we leave the node running, we would give the user a chance
-- to submit a bug report from the Daedalus interface.
--
-- However when @forced@ is True the migration is a all-or-nothing.
-- If anything fails the node crashes.
