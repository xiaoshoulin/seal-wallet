  The AddressPool module enables BIP44-style address and account discovery
  for Externally Owned Sequential (EOS) wallets.

  For EOS wallets, we can't add new accounts and therefore can't discover any
  accounts that were not provided upfront.

  In this style of address discovery we can make no assumptions about the sequence
  of accounts, we can only discover addresses in the given wallets (and indeed
  add new addresses to be discovered)
